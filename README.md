We have built a smartwatch app which will detect the amount of stress a person is currently going through. The app will detect it using various techniques like the amount of sweating the user is having or the abnormalitiy in the user's pulse rate.  Along with these, there will be additional benefits of getting therapy, scheduling calls with counsellors.
